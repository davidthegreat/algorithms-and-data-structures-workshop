1. Create a reverse method that uses a stack data structure to reverse a string. reverse("duck") should return "kcud".


2. The ( and ) parenthesis need to be balanced in programming language. (5+6)*(7+8)/(4+3) is a valid expression because the parenthesis are properly matched, but ())) is not a valid expression. Write a balanced_parenthesis? that takes a string and returns true/false if the parenthesis are balanced. Use a stack to solve the problem!

`example:` balanced_parenthesis?('((()))') should return true

`example:` balanced_parenthesis?('(()') should return false

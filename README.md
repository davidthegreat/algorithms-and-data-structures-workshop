## Data Structures and Algorithms Workshop

During this workshop you will learn several fundamental principles of algorithm design: divide-and-conquer methods, practical data structures and will be able to solve typical interview questions.

Every topic contains links to challenges and additional materials for reading and preparations.

In this unit we are going to cover next topics:

1. Sorting and Searching
  1. [Binary Search](sorting-searching/BinarySearch.md)
  2. [Merge Sort](sorting-searching/MergeSort.md)
  3. [Quick Sort](sorting-searching/QuickSort.md)

Data Structures:

1. [Arrays](arrays-and-strings/Arrays.md)
2. [Strings](arrays-and-strings/Strings.md)
3. [Linked Lists](linked-list/LinkedList.md)
4. [Stacks](stacks/Stacks.md)
5. Heaps
6. [Queues](queues/Queues.md)
7. Trees

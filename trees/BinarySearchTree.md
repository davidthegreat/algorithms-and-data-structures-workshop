## Binary Search Tree
What is difference between Binary Tree and Binary Search Tree?

### Inorder, preorder, postorder traverse
You are given a pointer to the root of a binary search tree; print the values in preorder, inorder and postorder traversal.

### Insert, find and delete element
Implement insert, find and delete operations for Binary Search Tree.

### Valid Binary Search Tree
Check if BST is a valid BST.

### Lowest Common Ancestor of a BST
You are given pointer to the root of the binary search tree and two values v1 and v2. You need to return the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of v1 and v2 in the binary search tree.

### Height of a Binary Tree
The height of a binary tree is the number of nodes on the largest path from root to any leaf. You are given a pointer to the root of a binary tree. Return the height of the tree.
